## Description

WiP


## Installation

### Dependencies
None at the moment. :)

### Licensing

Currently, the licensing terms of this mod is messed up:

* The original mod was licensed under MIT.
* At [2015-0111](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/49443-airships-in-13-hooliganlabs-mods/&do=findComment&comment=1647471), the "current copyright claimer" claim it was changed to Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-NDï»¿ 4.0).
* [2016-0509](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/49443-airships-in-13-hooliganlabs-mods/&do=findComment&comment=2571512), it was claimed that the license was changed to All Rights Reserved.
* [2018-0326](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/49443-airships-in-13-hooliganlabs-mods/&do=findComment&comment=3335548), the original author states again the MIT License on his works.

However, the official Wiki states that all HooliganLabs mods are MIT. No word from dunclaw, who implemeted some code and add some parts to the upstream.

Given the current mess in the licensing, the only right I can grant to you is the right to fork this repo, as demanded by [GitHub TOS](https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/).
 
I state clearly and firmly that any code of mine is licensed to the original author's on the very same terms the code is licensed to me.

I grant to anyone rights to download and use **my** changes on the product.

I'm working hard to solve this mess in the near future.
